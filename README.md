# Code created by Laura Jimenez. First version: May 2018

This repository contains functions that create accumulation curves of occurrences in the area of study based on the output of an SDM algorithm. There are two versions of the function and they required diferent arguments and input files.
I am working on a paper were the details on how these curves are created will be presented together with some examples of their applications and uses.
'Occurrence_accum_curve' always produces figures as part of the output, as well as a matrix with the values needed to recreate a curve of accumulation of occurrences.
'Occurrence_accum_curve1' works directly with the raster file that contains the output of an SDM, it calculates the points of the curve but does not produces any plot.
